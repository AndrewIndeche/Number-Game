# Numbers-Game

The objective of the game is to guess a number that is randomly generated by the game engine. On each guess, the game will indicate (using a message) how Low or High your guess is from the actual generated number. Upon guessing the correct number, one is presented with the option to play again.

## Description
The user goes to the App and finds a homepage that tells them the rules of the game and allows them to play the game as a guest.

They have 3 chances to guess the correct number(which has already been generated at random and saved by the computer).

If the number is higher than the correct number, they should get a message telling them that the number they guessed was too high.

If the number is lower than the correct number, they should get a message telling them that the number they guessed was too low. 

However, if they fail to get the correct number after 3 tries, regardless of whether the number they put in was high or low, they should get a message that they failed and also the number they should have guessed.  

The game should also keep their wins vs losses for as long as the window is open (so if they were to close the window, they would lose all the stats. Unless they are logged in, if they have an account and log in, they should always be able to view the number of games won and Number of games lost cumulatively)
