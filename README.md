# Numbers-Game
The user goes to the App and there is a homepage that tells them the rules of the game and allows them to play the game.  They have 3 chances to guess the correct number(which has already been generated at random and saved by the computer). If the number is higher than the correct number, they should get a message telling them that the number they guessed was too high. If the number is lower than the correct number, they should get a message telling them that the number they guessed was too low. However, if they fail to get the correct number after 3 tries, regardless of whether the number they put in was high or low, they should get a message that they failed and also the number they should have guessed.  The game should also keep their wins vs. losses for as long as the window is open(so if they were to close the window, they would lose all  the stats. Unless they are logged in, if they have an account and log in, they should always be able to view their  number of games won and Number of games lost cumulatively)
